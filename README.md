# Facial Recognition with Transformers & Triplet Loss

A robust facial recognition system leveraging triplet loss-based CNN embeddings and transformer methods, optimized for discriminative face verification on the LFW dataset. Seamless integration with DeepFace and Google Colab for rapid prototyping and standardized competition-style evaluation.

---

## Overview

This project implements an advanced facial recognition pipeline designed for research and practical applications in identity verification. It combines triplet loss-driven convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn highly discriminative facial embeddings, ensuring accurate identity matching. The system is built to run efficiently within Google Colab environments, streamlining image capture, preprocessing, model training, and verification workflows.

Key components include:
- **Triplet Loss**: Enhances the discriminative power of facial embeddings by optimizing anchor-positive-negative image relationships.
- **CNN-based Embeddings**: Deep convolutional architectures extract robust facial features.
- **LFW Dataset**: Evaluation is standardized using the widely recognized Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.
- **DeepFace Integration**: Simplifies verification and leverages state-of-the-art backends.

## Key Features

- **Triplet Loss-Based CNN**: Learns facial representations that maximize inter-class separation and intra-class compactness.
- **End-to-End Colab Workflow**: Captures, preprocesses, and verifies images directly within interactive notebooks.
- **Competition-Ready Output**: Formats results for standardized evaluation and leaderboard submission.
- **DeepFace Library Support**: Enables flexible backend selection and streamlined verification routines.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Google Colab** (recommended)
- **TensorFlow** (v2.x)
- **Keras**
- **DeepFace**
- **NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib**

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jihed01-sc/Facial-Recognition_Transformers_Method.git
   cd Facial-Recognition_Transformers_Method
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies (within Colab or locally):**
   ```python
   !pip install tensorflow keras deepface opencv-python matplotlib
   ```

3. **Prepare the LFW Dataset:**
   - Download LFW from [LFW official site](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/).
   - Place images in the `data/lfw/` directory.
   - Update paths in notebook cells if using a custom location.

### Colab-Specific Configurations

- Ensure GPU acceleration is enabled (`Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU`).
- Use Colab’s file upload utilities for custom image inputs.

## Usage

### 1. Capturing & Preprocessing Images

```python
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Capture and display image
img = cv2.imread('data/lfw/person.jpg')
img = cv2.resize(img, (160, 160))
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
plt.show()

# Preprocess for model input
img = img / 255.0
```

### 2. Training the Triplet Loss Model

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input
from triplet_loss import build_triplet_model, triplet_loss_fn  # Custom implementation

anchor = Input(shape=(160, 160, 3))
positive = Input(shape=(160, 160, 3))
negative = Input(shape=(160, 160, 3))

model = build_triplet_model(anchor, positive, negative)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=triplet_loss_fn)
model.fit([anchors, positives, negatives], epochs=XX)
```

### 3. Running Identity Verification (DeepFace Example)

```python
from deepface import DeepFace

result = DeepFace.verify("img1.jpg", "img2.jpg", model_name='Facenet', detector_backend='opencv')
print("Verification:", result["verified"])
```
